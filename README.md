## !! Final Implementation - To Do
- The final implementation is due Friday **December 08** 2023. You will submit a tag from your repository (git tag final; git push --tags) to the CourSys activity Project.

- In your repository, please include a file **RUNNING.txt (or RUNNING.md if you prefer)** indicating how we can actually test your project: commands on the cluster, input files, etc.

- In your repository's **README.md**, you may include other notes about things we should look for, or be aware of when marking. If you created some kind of web frontend, please include a URL in the README.md as well.

## Summary
Our project aims to investigate and analyze Airbnb’s listing data and the broader housing market within the Greater Vancouver Area, and explore the relationships between Airbnb listings’ pricing, location, durations of stay, and its profitability in different neighborhoods. Additionally, we will leverage Vancouver's rental data statistics to assess the impact of Airbnb on the affordability of housing in various neighborhoods.

## Objectives
- Explore the relationship between different elements of an Airbnb listing and it’s profitability
- Assess the impact of Airbnb on the rental prices of different neighborhoods
- Visualize our findings in a way that’s interactive and easy to understand

## Dataset
- Inside Airbnb (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/)
- CMHC Housing Market Information (https://www03.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/hmip-pimh/)
- REBGV Market Watch (https://www.rebgv.org/market-watch/)
- … and more

## Technology
- We plan to utilize PySpark as our main data analysis tool.
- We’ll likely utilize cloud computing services like Amazon S3 and EC2/EMR to help process our data. 
- D3.js is chosen as our data visualization framework.
- More technologies will be involved if necessary as we take on our project.


## Interesting questions as a glimpse
