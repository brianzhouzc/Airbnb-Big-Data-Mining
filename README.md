## Subject
Airbnb Big Data Mining

## Summary
Our project aims to investigate and analyze Airbnb’s listing data and the broader housing market within the Greater Vancouver Area, and explore the relationships between Airbnb listings’ pricing, location, durations of stay, and its profitability in different neighborhoods. Additionally, we will leverage Vancouver's rental data statistics to assess the impact of Airbnb on the affordability of housing in various neighborhoods.

## Objectives
Explore the relationship between different elements of an Airbnb listing and it’s profitability
Assess the impact of Airbnb on the rental prices of different neighborhoods
Visualize our findings in a way that’s interactive and easy to understand

## Technology
We plan to utilize PySpark as our main data analysis tool.

D3.js is chosen as our data visualization framework.
More technologies will be involved if necessary as we take on our project.
